## Recent Changes

### Voice Call Architecture Migration (October 2025)
**Migration from Custom VAD to OpenAI Realtime API for Phone Calls - PRODUCTION READY**

- **Previous Architecture**: Custom client-side VAD → Whisper STT → OpenAI Chat → Azure TTS (complex, quality issues)
- **New Architecture**: OpenAI Realtime API with server-side VAD (simple, production-grade)
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Eliminated false voice detection issues through server-side VAD
  - Reduced latency with single-hop WebSocket architecture
  - Improved audio quality with native μ-law ↔ PCM16 conversion
  - Unified architecture with customer simulation (both use Realtime API)
  - Native RAG integration via function calls
  - Natural conversation flow with automatic turn-taking
  
- **Implementation**: Edge Function `twilio-voice-realtime` bridges Twilio Media Streams to OpenAI Realtime API
  - Proper WebSocket authentication using required subprotocols: `realtime`, `openai-insecure-api-key.{KEY}`, `openai-beta.realtime-v1`
  - Audio codec conversion: μ-law ↔ PCM16, 8kHz ↔ 24kHz resampling
  - Tenant-specific configuration via Twilio customParameters
  - Server-side VAD handles all turn detection automatically (no manual buffer commits/response creation)
  
- **Critical Fixes Applied**:
  - Added missing `openai-beta.realtime-v1` subprotocol for Deno WebSocket authentication
  - Removed manual response creation to prevent "conversation already has active response" errors
  - Server-side VAD now handles all turn-taking automatically
  - Tenant ID extraction from Twilio customParameters (URL params stripped during WebSocket upgrade)
  
- **Status**: ✅ Production-ready, fully tested, natural conversations working perfectly

### Render.com Deployment Migration (October 2025)
**Solving Supabase's 6-Minute WebSocket Limit - PRODUCTION READY**

- **Problem Identified**: Supabase Edge Functions has a **400-second (6m 40s) wall clock limit** for WebSocket connections, causing calls to disconnect
- **Solution**: Hybrid architecture deploying voice function to Render.com while keeping all other infrastructure on Supabase
- **Architecture**:
  - `twilio-router` remains on Supabase (quick TwiML generation, no WebSocket)
  - `twilio-voice-realtime` deployed to Render.com (unlimited WebSocket duration)
  - Router uses `TWILIO_STREAM_URL` environment variable to route to Render
  - Render service still integrates with Supabase for tenant config and knowledge base
  
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Standalone Deno service on Render.com with Docker deployment
  - Same audio pipeline and OpenAI Realtime API integration
  - Health check endpoint at `/health` for monitoring
  - Environment-based configuration switching via `TWILIO_STREAM_URL=wss://voice-relay-realtime.onrender.com`
  - **Critical**: Must use `wss://` protocol (WebSocket Secure), not `https://`
  
- **Deployment Files** (in `render/` directory):
  - `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for Deno runtime
  - `twilio-voice-realtime.ts` - Standalone voice service
  - `QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute deployment guide
  - `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
  - `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Architecture overview and testing
  
- **Cost**: $7/month for Render.com Starter plan (always-on, no WebSocket limits)
- **Benefits**: 
  - ✅ No call duration limits (vs 6-minute Supabase cutoff)
  - ✅ Keep Supabase for database, auth, storage, other functions
  - ✅ Simple environment variable switch between architectures
  - ✅ Production-ready with health checks and monitoring
  - ✅ Easy rollback (remove `TWILIO_STREAM_URL` env var)
  
- **Status**: ✅ Implementation complete, documentation verified, ready for production deployment
