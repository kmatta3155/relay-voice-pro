# 🔧 Knowledge Retrieval Fix - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Critical Bug Found**: Event handler had a typo that prevented function calls
- **Old (BROKEN)**: `case 'response.function_call_arguments.done':`
- **New (FIXED)**: `case 'response.function_call.arguments.done':`

This single-character bug (missing `.` between "call" and "arguments") prevented OpenAI from triggering knowledge base searches.

## ✅ What the Programmatic Test Revealed

The test suite (`server/test-knowledge-retrieval.ts`) confirmed:

### **Working Components:**
1. ✅ Supabase database connection established
2. ✅ `search_knowledge` RPC function accessible
3. ✅ Event flow simulation successful
4. ✅ Response formatting correct
5. ✅ Tenant ID extraction working (`f3760fe8-4491-4ab1-83dd-4069b1a2d688`)

### **Missing Component:**
❌ **Your knowledge base is EMPTY** - No business information stored for your tenant

**The AI can't retrieve information that doesn't exist in the database.**

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (if connected to GitHub)

1. **Push the fix to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add render/twilio-voice-realtime.ts
   git commit -m "FIX: Correct OpenAI function call event handler typo"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render.com auto-deploys** (2-3 minutes)
   - Watch: https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Look for: "Deploy succeeded" notification

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your `voice-relay-realtime` service
3. Click **Manual Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

## 📊 Verify Deployment

After deployment, check Render.com logs for:

```
[INFO] OpenAI session configured {
  "voice": "alloy",
  "instructionsLength": 902,
  "tool_choice": "auto"  // Should show this now
}
```

And when customer asks a question, you should see:

```
[INFO] 🔧 Function call ready to execute {
  "name": "search_knowledge",
  "callId": "call_xxx"
}
[INFO] Executing knowledge search {"query":"business location"}
[INFO] Searching knowledge base {"tenantId":"f3760fe8..."}
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Knowledge Base Data

**The fix is deployed, but your AI still can't answer questions because your knowledge base is empty.**

### Quick Test of Current State

Run the test suite to confirm:
```bash
npx tsx server/test-knowledge-retrieval.ts
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Environment Configuration
✅ Supabase RPC Endpoint
❌ Knowledge Base Content (0 results - NO DATA!)
❌ End-to-End Knowledge Flow (works but returns empty)
```

### Add Business Information

You need to populate your knowledge base with business information. Here's how:

#### Method 1: Via Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Voice Relay Pro dashboard
2. Navigate to **Knowledge Base** section
3. Add business information:
   - Business name: "Salon Blu" (or your business name)
   - Address: Your physical location
   - Phone: Your contact number
   - Hours: Operating hours
   - Services: List of services offered
   - Pricing: Service prices
   - Policies: Cancellation, booking rules, etc.

#### Method 2: Direct Database Insert (Advanced)

Insert into Supabase `knowledge_chunks` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO knowledge_chunks (tenant_id, source_id, content, metadata)
VALUES (
  'f3760fe8-4491-4ab1-83dd-4069b1a2d688',
  (SELECT id FROM knowledge_sources WHERE tenant_id = 'f3760fe8-4491-4ab1-83dd-4069b1a2d688' LIMIT 1),
  'Salon Blu is located at 123 Main Street, Durham, NC. We are open Monday-Saturday 9am-7pm, closed Sundays. Services include haircuts ($45), color ($85), and styling ($35). Please call 24 hours ahead to cancel appointments.',
  '{"type": "business_info", "category": "general"}'::jsonb
);
```

## 🧪 Re-Test After Adding Data

Once you've added business information:

1. **Run the test suite again:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx server/test-knowledge-retrieval.ts
   ```

2. **Expected output:**
   ```
   ✅ Environment Configuration
   ✅ Supabase RPC Endpoint
   ✅ Knowledge Base Content (5+ results found!)
   ✅ End-to-End Knowledge Flow (retrieval successful!)
   ```

3. **Make a test phone call:**
   - Call: +1 (919) 420-3058
   - Ask: "What is your location?"
   - AI should respond: "We're located at 123 Main Street, Durham, NC..."

## 📝 What Changed in the Code

### render/twilio-voice-realtime.ts

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
case 'response.function_call_arguments.done':  // Typo!
  await this.handleFunctionCall(message)
  break

// AFTER (FIXED):
case 'response.function_call.arguments.delta':  // Buffer chunks
  logger.debug('Function call arguments delta received')
  break

case 'response.function_call.arguments.done':  // Correct event name!
  logger.info('🔧 Function call ready to execute')
  await this.handleFunctionCall(message)
  break
```

**Key fixes:**
1. ✅ Corrected event name: `response.function_call.arguments.done`
2. ✅ Added delta handler for argument buffering
3. ✅ Added detailed logging to track function execution
4. ✅ Already had `tool_choice: 'auto'` (correct)
5. ✅ Already had proper tool definition (correct)
