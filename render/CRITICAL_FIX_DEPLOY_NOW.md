# üö® CRITICAL FIX - DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY

## The Problem

Your voice agent was **silently ignoring all function calls** because of an event name mismatch!

**What you saw**: AI says "Let me find the hours for you" ‚Üí silence ‚Üí nothing happens

**Why**: The code was listening for `response.function_call.arguments.done` (with dot) but OpenAI sends `response.function_call_arguments.done` (no dot between "call" and "arguments").

## The Fix

Changed event handler in `render/twilio-voice-realtime.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
case 'response.function_call.arguments.done':  // ‚ùå Extra dot!

// AFTER (FIXED):  
case 'response.function_call_arguments.done':  // ‚úÖ No dot!
```

This is a **single-character fix** that makes function calling work!

## Evidence from Your Logs

Your logs show OpenAI IS triggering the function:
```
[INFO] OpenAI event: response.function_call_arguments.done
```

But the voice service never logged "üîß Function call ready to execute", meaning the case statement didn't match.

## Deploy Now
